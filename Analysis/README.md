The analysis of the reconstructions was done by feeding the three reconstructions and the random reconstruction through the Alexnet neural network and checking the correlation between the features of the reconstructions and the real test video, this can be done in "determine_results_with_alexnet.py". The significances between the correlation were determined in "determine_significance.py".
