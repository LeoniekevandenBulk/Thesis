The analysis of the reconstructions was done by feeding the three reconstructions and the random reconstruction through the Alexnet neural network [1] and checking the correlation between the features of the reconstructions and the real test video, this can be done in "determine_results_with_alexnet.py". The significances between the correlation were determined in "determine_significance.py".
