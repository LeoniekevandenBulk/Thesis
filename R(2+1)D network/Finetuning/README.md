The R(2+1)D network was created by Tran et al. and can be found on https://github.com/facebookresearch/VMZ/blob/master/tutorials/models.md. A version adapted from Caffe2 to Pytorch was used here. In order to finetune the network, the kinetics dataset first needs to be downloaded through the "download_kinetics.py" script. Then the network can be finetuned with "finetune.py". Note that both the weights of the original network and the finetuned network are available, and can be found on: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oex9sayi7yphnqu/AACFnl29IMR-RDWmNKVNRotua?dl=0
