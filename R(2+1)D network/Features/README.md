The "ComputeR2Plus1DFeaturesTrainingVideos.py" script computes the R(2+1)D features from the training set videos. Note that the features are computed for all five blocks in the network, but only the features from the last pooled block have been used in this research. 

Because it would be too costly for memory to save the R(2+1)D prior features, these are calculated on the fly while selecting the best prior videos (code in the EncodingAndDecoding folder).
